# mandi Version 3.2.2

This is the home of the [mandi](https://github.com/heafnerj/mandi) LaTeX 
bundle for introductory physics. TeX Live includes `mandi` but not necessarily 
the latest version, which can always be found here.

Installation is best done using [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/),
[MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/), or [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/) package 
managers. Users and package developers who want to manually install should fetch
the `mandi.zip` file, and read the `mandi.ins` file for further instructions. 
The documentation is in the `mandi.zip` file and as long as the `*.sty` files 
have been unpacked there's really nothing more to do other than moving the files 
to a suitable location. Manual installation is basically a thing of the past.
